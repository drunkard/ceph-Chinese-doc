 RGW 动态的桶索引重分片
========================

.. versionadded:: Luminous

A large bucket index can lead to performance problems. In order
to address this problem we introduced bucket index sharding.
Until Luminous, changing the number of bucket shards (resharding)
needed to be done offline. Starting with Luminous we support
online bucket resharding.

Each bucket index shard can handle its entries efficiently up until
reaching a certain threshold number of entries. If this threshold is
exceeded the system can suffer from performance issues. The dynamic
resharding feature detects this situation and automatically increases
the number of shards used by the bucket index, resulting in a
reduction of the number of entries in each bucket index shard. This
process is transparent to the user. Write I/Os to the target bucket
are blocked and read I/Os are not during resharding process.

By default dynamic bucket index resharding can only increase the
number of bucket index shards to 1999, although this upper-bound is a
configuration parameter (see Configuration below). When
possible, the process chooses a prime number of bucket index shards to
spread the number of bucket index entries across the bucket index
shards more evenly.

The detection process runs in a background process that periodically
scans all the buckets. A bucket that requires resharding is added to
the resharding queue and will be scheduled to be resharded later. The
reshard thread runs in the background and execute the scheduled
resharding tasks, one at a time.

.. Configuration

配置选项
========
启用、禁用动态的桶索引重分片功能：

- ``rgw_dynamic_resharding``:  true/false, default: true.

Configuration options that control the resharding process:

- ``rgw_max_objs_per_shard``: maximum number of objects per bucket index shard before resharding is triggered, default: 100000 objects

- ``rgw_max_dynamic_shards``: maximum number of shards that dynamic bucket index resharding can increase to, default: 1999

- ``rgw_reshard_bucket_lock_duration``: duration, in seconds, of lock on bucket obj during resharding, default: 360 seconds (i.e., 6 minutes)

- ``rgw_reshard_thread_interval``: maximum time, in seconds, between rounds of resharding queue processing, default: 600 seconds (i.e., 10 minutes)

- ``rgw_reshard_num_logs``: number of shards for the resharding queue, default: 16


.. Admin commands

管理命令
========


.. Add a bucket to the resharding queue

把一个桶加进重分片队列
----------------------

::

   # radosgw-admin reshard add --bucket <bucket_name> --num-shards <new number of shards>


.. List resharding queue

罗列重分片队列
--------------

::

   # radosgw-admin reshard list


.. Process tasks on the resharding queue

处理重分片队列里的任务
----------------------

::

   # radosgw-admin reshard process


.. Bucket resharding status

桶重分片状态
------------

::

   # radosgw-admin reshard status --bucket <bucket_name>

The output is a json array of 3 objects (reshard_status, new_bucket_instance_id, num_shards) per shard.

For example, the output at different Dynamic Resharding stages is shown below:

``1. Before resharding occurred:``
::

  [
    {
        "reshard_status": "not-resharding",
        "new_bucket_instance_id": "",
        "num_shards": -1
    }
  ]

``2. During resharding:``
::

  [
    {
        "reshard_status": "in-progress",
        "new_bucket_instance_id": "1179f470-2ebf-4630-8ec3-c9922da887fd.8652.1",
        "num_shards": 2
    },
    {
        "reshard_status": "in-progress",
        "new_bucket_instance_id": "1179f470-2ebf-4630-8ec3-c9922da887fd.8652.1",
        "num_shards": 2
    }
  ]

``3, After resharding completed:``
::

  [
    {
        "reshard_status": "not-resharding",
        "new_bucket_instance_id": "",
        "num_shards": -1
    },
    {
        "reshard_status": "not-resharding",
        "new_bucket_instance_id": "",
        "num_shards": -1
    }
  ]


.. Cancel pending bucket resharding

取消挂着的桶重分片操作
----------------------

注意：正在进行着的桶重分片操作无法取消。 ::

   # radosgw-admin reshard cancel --bucket <bucket_name>


.. Manual immediate bucket resharding

手动执行即时桶重分片
--------------------

::

   # radosgw-admin bucket reshard --bucket <bucket_name> --num-shards <new number of shards>

When choosing a number of shards, the administrator should keep a
number of items in mind. Ideally the administrator is aiming for no
more than 100000 entries per shard, now and through some future point
in time.

Additionally, bucket index shards that are prime numbers tend to work
better in evenly distributing bucket index entries across the
shards. For example, 7001 bucket index shards is better than 7000
since the former is prime. A variety of web sites have lists of prime
numbers; search for "list of prime numbers" withy your favorite web
search engine to locate some web sites.


.. Troubleshooting

故障排除
========

Clusters prior to Luminous 12.2.11 and Mimic 13.2.5 left behind stale bucket
instance entries, which were not automatically cleaned up. The issue also affected
LifeCycle policies, which were not applied to resharded buckets anymore. Both of
these issues can be worked around using a couple of radosgw-admin commands.


.. Stale instance management

掉队例程管理
------------

List the stale instances in a cluster that are ready to be cleaned up.

::

   # radosgw-admin reshard stale-instances list

Clean up the stale instances in a cluster. Note: cleanup of these
instances should only be done on a single site cluster.

::

   # radosgw-admin reshard stale-instances rm


.. Lifecycle fixes

生命周期修复
------------

For clusters that had resharded instances, it is highly likely that the old
lifecycle processes would have flagged and deleted lifecycle processing as the
bucket instance changed during a reshard. While this is fixed for newer clusters
(from Mimic 13.2.6 and Luminous 12.2.12), older buckets that had lifecycle policies and
that have undergone resharding will have to be manually fixed.

The command to do so is:

::

   # radosgw-admin lc reshard fix --bucket {bucketname}


As a convenience wrapper, if the ``--bucket`` argument is dropped then this
command will try and fix lifecycle policies for all the buckets in the cluster.


.. Object Expirer fixes

对象逾期管理器修复
------------------

Objects subject to Swift object expiration on older clusters may have
been dropped from the log pool and never deleted after the bucket was
resharded. This would happen if their expiration time was before the
cluster was upgraded, but if their expiration was after the upgrade
the objects would be correctly handled. To manage these expire-stale
objects, radosgw-admin provides two subcommands.

罗列：

::

   # radosgw-admin objects expire-stale list --bucket {bucketname}

Displays a list of object names and expiration times in JSON format.

删除：

::

   # radosgw-admin objects expire-stale rm --bucket {bucketname}


Initiates deletion of such objects, displaying a list of object names, expiration times, and deletion status in JSON format.
