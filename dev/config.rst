 配置管理系统
==============
.. Configuration Management System

The configuration management system exists to provide every daemon with the
proper configuration information. The configuration can be viewed as a set of
key-value pairs.

How can the configuration be set? Well, there are several sources:
 - the ceph configuration file, usually named ceph.conf
 - command line arguments::

    --debug-ms=1
    --debug-pg=10

   etc.
 - 在运行时用 injectargs 或 config set 注入的参数


配置文件
========
.. The Configuration File

Most configuration settings originate in the Ceph configuration file.

How do we find the configuration file? Well, in order, we check:

 - the default locations
 - the environment variable CEPH_CONF
 - the command line argument -c

Each stanza of the configuration file describes the key-value pairs that will be in
effect for a particular subset of the daemons. The "global" stanza applies to
everything. The "mon", "osd", and "mds" stanzas specify settings to take effect
for all monitors, all OSDs, and all mds servers, respectively.  A stanza of the
form mon.$name, osd.$name, or mds.$name gives settings for the monitor, OSD, or
MDS of that name, respectively. Configuration values that appear later in the
file win over earlier ones.

A sample configuration file can be found in src/sample.ceph.conf.


.. Metavariables

元变量
======

The configuration system allows any configuration value to be
substituted into another value using the ``$varname`` syntax, similar
to how bash shell expansion works.

A few additional special metavariables are also defined:

 - $host: expands to the current hostname
 - $type: expands to one of "mds", "osd", "mon", or "client"
 - $id: expands to the daemon identifier. For ``osd.0``, this would be ``0``; for ``mds.a``, it would be ``a``; for ``client.admin``, it would be ``admin``.
 - $num: same as $id
 - $name: expands to $type.$id


.. Reading configuration values

读取配置值
==========

There are two ways for Ceph code to get configuration values. One way is to
read it directly from a variable named "g_conf," or equivalently,
"g_ceph_ctx->_conf." The other is to register an observer that will be called
every time the relevant configuration values changes.  This observer will be
called soon after the initial configuration is read, and every time after that
when one of the relevant values changes. Each observer tracks a set of keys
and is invoked only when one of the relevant keys changes.

The interface to implement is found in common/config_obs.h.

The observer method should be preferred in new code because

 - It is more flexible, allowing the code to do whatever reinitialization needs
   to be done to implement the new configuration value.
 - It is the only way to create a std::string configuration variable that can
   be changed by injectargs.
 - Even for int-valued configuration options, changing the values in one thread
   while another thread is reading them can lead to subtle and
   impossible-to-diagnose bugs.

For these reasons, reading directly from g_conf should be considered deprecated
and not done in new code.  Do not ever alter g_conf.


更改配置值
==========
.. Changing configuration values

Configuration values can be changed by calling ``g_conf()->set_val``. After changing
the configuration, you should call ``g_conf()->apply_changes`` to re-run all the
affected configuration observers. For convenience, you can call
``g_conf()->set_val_or_die`` to make a configuration change which you think should
never fail.

Injectargs, parse_argv, and parse_env are three other functions which modify
the configuration. Just like with set_val, you should call apply_changes after
calling these functions to make sure your changes get applied.


定义配置选项
============
.. Defining config options

新风格的配置选项定义在 common/options.cc 内。所有新配置选项都\
应该放这里（而不是 legacy_config_opts.h ）。

Levels
------

The Option constructor takes a "level" value:

* *LEVEL_BASIC* is for basic config options that a normal operator is likely to adjust.
* *LEVEL_ADVANCED* is for options that an operator *can* adjust, but should not touch unless they understand what they are doing. Adjusting advanced options poorly can lead to problems (performance or even data loss) if done incorrectly.
* *LEVEL_DEV* is for options in place for use by developers only, either for testing purposes, or to describe constants that no user should adjust but we prefer not to compile into the code.


描述和详细描述
--------------
.. Description and long description

Short description of the option. Sentence fragment. e.g.::

  .set_description("Default checksum algorithm to use")

The long description is complete sentences, perhaps even multiple
paragraphs, and may include other detailed information or notes.::

  .set_long_description("crc32c, xxhash32, and xxhash64 are available.  The _16 and _8 variants use only a subset of the bits for more compact (but less reliable) checksumming.")


默认值
------
.. Default values

There is a default value for every config option. In some cases, there may
also be a *daemon default* that only applies to code that declares itself
as a daemon (in this case, the regular default only applies to non-daemons).

安全性
------
.. Safety

If an option can be safely changed at runtime::

  .set_safe()

服务
----
.. Service

Service is a component name, like "common", "osd", "rgw", "mds", etc. It may
be a list of components, like::

  .add_service("mon mds osd mgr")

For example, the rocksdb options affect both the osd and mon.

标签
----
.. Tags

Tags identify options across services that relate in some way. Example include;

  - network -- options affecting network configuration
  - mkfs -- options that only matter at mkfs time

枚举值
------
.. Enums

For options with a defined set of allowed values::

  .set_enum_allowed({"none", "crc32c", "crc32c_16", "crc32c_8", "xxhash32", "xxhash64"})

标记
----
.. Flags

* **RUNTIME**: the value can be updated at runtime
* **NO_MON_UPDATE**: Daemons/clients do not pull this value from the monitor config database.  We disallow setting this option via 'ceph config set ...'.  This option should be configured via ceph.conf or via the command line.
* **STARTUP**: option takes effect only during daemon startup
* **CLUSTER_CREATE**: option only affects cluster creation
* **CREATE**: option only affects daemon creation
