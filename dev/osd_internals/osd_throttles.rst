 OSD 油门（ throttle ）
========================

There are three significant throttles in the FileStore OSD back end:
wbthrottle, op_queue_throttle, and a throttle based on journal usage.

WBThrottle
----------
The WBThrottle is defined in src/os/filestore/WBThrottle.[h,cc] and
included in FileStore as FileStore::wbthrottle.  The intention is to
bound the amount of outstanding IO we need to do to flush the journal.
At the same time, we don't want to necessarily do it inline in case we
might be able to combine several IOs on the same object close together
in time.  Thus, in FileStore::_write, we queue the fd for asynchronous
flushing and block in FileStore::_do_op if we have exceeded any hard
limits until the background flusher catches up.

The relevant config options are filestore_wbthrottle*.  There are
different defaults for XFS and Btrfs.  Each set has hard and soft
limits on bytes (total dirty bytes), ios (total dirty ios), and
inodes (total dirty fds).  The WBThrottle will begin flushing
when any of these hits the soft limit and will block in throttle()
while any has exceeded the hard limit.

Tighter soft limits will cause writeback to happen more quickly,
but may cause the OSD to miss oportunities for write coalescing.
Tighter hard limits may cause a reduction in latency variance by
reducing time spent flushing the journal, but may reduce writeback
parallelism.

op_queue_throttle
-----------------
The op queue throttle is intended to bound the amount of queued but
uncompleted work in the filestore by delaying threads calling
queue_transactions more and more based on how many ops and bytes are
currently queued.  The throttle is taken in queue_transactions and
released when the op is applied to the file system.  This period
includes time spent in the journal queue, time spent writing to the
journal, time spent in the actual op queue, time spent waiting for the
wbthrottle to open up (thus, the wbthrottle can push back indirectly
on the queue_transactions caller), and time spent actually applying
the op to the file system.  A BackoffThrottle is used to gradually
delay the queueing thread after each throttle becomes more than
filestore_queue_low_threshhold full (a ratio of
filestore_queue_max_(bytes|ops)).  The throttles will block once the
max value is reached (filestore_queue_max_(bytes|ops)).

The significant config options are:
filestore_queue_low_threshhold
filestore_queue_high_threshhold
filestore_expected_throughput_ops
filestore_expected_throughput_bytes
filestore_queue_high_delay_multiple
filestore_queue_max_delay_multiple

While each throttle is at less than low_threshold of the max,
no delay happens.  Between low and high, the throttle will
inject a per-op delay (per op or byte) ramping from 0 at low to
high_delay_multiple/expected_throughput at high.  From high to
1, the delay will ramp from high_delay_multiple/expected_throughput
to max_delay_multiple/expected_throughput.

filestore_queue_high_delay_multiple and
filestore_queue_max_delay_multiple probably do not need to be
changed.

Setting these properly should help to smooth out op latencies by
mostly avoiding the hard limit.

See FileStore::throttle_ops and FileSTore::thottle_bytes.

journal usage throttle
----------------------
See src/os/filestore/JournalThrottle.h/cc

The intention of the journal usage throttle is to gradually slow
down queue_transactions callers as the journal fills up in order
to smooth out hiccup during filestore syncs.  JournalThrottle
wraps a BackoffThrottle and tracks journaled but not flushed
journal entries so that the throttle can be released when the
journal is flushed.  The configs work very similarly to the
op_queue_throttle.

The significant config options are:
journal_throttle_low_threshhold
journal_throttle_high_threshhold
filestore_expected_throughput_ops
filestore_expected_throughput_bytes
journal_throttle_high_multiple
journal_throttle_max_multiple
