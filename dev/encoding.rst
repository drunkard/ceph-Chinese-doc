序列化（编码、解码）
====================

When a structure is sent over the network or written to disk, it is
encoded into a string of bytes.  Serializable structures have
``encode`` and ``decode`` methods that write and read from ``bufferlist``
objects representing byte strings.

Adding a field to a structure
-----------------------------

You can see examples of this all over the Ceph code, but here's an
example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class AcmeClass
    {
        int member1;
        std::string member2;

        void encode(bufferlist &bl)
        {
            ENCODE_START(1, 1, bl);
            ::encode(member1, bl);
            ::encode(member2, bl);
            ENCODE_FINISH(bl);
        }

        void decode(bufferlist::iterator &bl)
        {
            DECODE_START(1, bl);
            ::decode(member1, bl);
            ::decode(member2, bl);
            DECODE_FINISH(bl);
        }
    };

The ``ENCODE_START`` macro writes a header that specifies a *version* and
a *compat_version* (both initially 1).  The message version is incremented
whenever a change is made to the encoding.  The compat_version is incremented
only if the change will break existing decoders -- decoders are tolerant
of trailing bytes, so changes that add fields at the end of the structure
do not require incrementing compat_version.

The ``DECODE_START`` macro takes an argument specifying the most recent
message version that the code can handle.  This is compared with the
compat_version encoded in the message, and if the message is too new then
an exception will be thrown.  Because changes to compat_verison are rare,
this isn't usually something to worry about when adding fields.

In practice, changes to encoding usually involve simply adding the desired fields
at the end of the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions, and incrementing
the versions in ``ENCODE_START`` and ``DECODE_START``.  For example, here's how
to add a third field to ``AcmeClass``:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class AcmeClass
    {
        int member1;
        std::string member2;
        std::vector<std::string> member3;

        void encode(bufferlist &bl)
        {
            ENCODE_START(2, 1, bl);
            ::encode(member1, bl);
            ::encode(member2, bl);
            ::encode(member3, bl);
            ENCODE_FINISH(bl);
        }

        void decode(bufferlist::iterator &bl)
        {
            DECODE_START(2, bl);
            ::decode(member1, bl);
            ::decode(member2, bl);
            if (struct_v >= 2) {
                ::decode(member3, bl);
            }
            DECODE_FINISH(bl);
        }
    };

Note that the compat_version did not change because the encoded message
will still be decodable by versions of the code that only understand
version 1 -- they will just ignore the trailing bytes where we encode ``member3``.

In the ``decode`` function, decoding the new field is conditional: this is
because we might still be passed older-versioned messages that do not
have the field.  The ``struct_v`` variable is a local set by the ``DECODE_START``
macro.
