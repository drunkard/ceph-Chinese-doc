======================
  Ceph Release Process
======================

1. Build environment
====================

There are multiple build environments, debian based packages are built via pbuilder for multiple distributions.  The build hosts are listed in the ``deb_hosts`` file, and the list of distributions are in ``deb_dist``.  All distributions are build on each of the build hosts.  Currently there is 1 64 bit and 1 32 bit build host.

The RPM based packages are built natively, so one distribution per build host.  The list of hosts is found in ``rpm_hosts``.

Prior to building, it's necessary to update the pbuilder seed tarballs::

    ./update_all_pbuilders.sh

2. Setup keyring for signing packages
=====================================

::

    export GNUPGHOME=<path to keyring dir>

    # verify it's accessible
    gpg --list-keys

The release key should be present::

  pub   4096R/17ED316D 2012-05-20
  uid   Ceph Release Key <sage@newdream.net>


3. Set up build area
====================

Clone the ceph and ceph-build source trees::

    git clone http://github.com/ceph/ceph.git
    git clone http://github.com/ceph/ceph-build.git

In the ceph source directory, checkout next branch (for point releases use the {codename} branch)::

    git checkout next

Checkout the submodules::

    git submodule update --force --init --recursive

4.  Update Build version numbers
================================

Substitute the ceph release number where indicated below by the string ``0.xx``.

Edit configure.ac and update the version number. Example diff::

	-AC_INIT([ceph], [0.54], [ceph-devel@vger.kernel.org])
	+AC_INIT([ceph], [0.55], [ceph-devel@vger.kernel.org])
 
Update the version number in the debian change log::

	DEBEMAIL user@host dch -v 0.xx-1

Commit the changes::

	git commit -a

Tag the release::

	../ceph-build/tag-release v0.xx


5. Create Makefiles
===================

The actual configure options used to build packages are in the
``ceph.spec.in`` and ``debian/rules`` files.  At this point we just
need to create a Makefile.::

	./do_autogen.sh


6. Run the release scripts
==========================

This creates tarballs and copies them, with other needed files to
the build hosts listed in deb_hosts and rpm_hosts, runs a local build
script, then rsyncs the results back to the specified release directory.::

	../ceph-build/do_release.sh /tmp/release


7. Create RPM Repo
==================

Copy the rpms to the destination repo::

       mkdir /tmp/rpm-repo
       ../ceph-build/push_to_rpm_repo.sh /tmp/release /tmp/rpm-repo 0.xx

Next add any additional rpms to the repo that are needed such as leveldb.
See RPM Backports section

Finally, sign the rpms and build the repo indexes::

  ../ceph-build/sign_and_index_rpm_repo.sh /tmp/release /tmp/rpm-repo 0.xx


8. Create Debian repo
=====================

The key-id used below is the id of the ceph release key from step 2::

	mkdir /tmp/debian-repo
	../ceph-build/gen_reprepro_conf.sh /tmp/debian-repo key-id
	../ceph-build/push_to_deb_repo.sh /tmp/release /tmp/debian-repo 0.xx main


Next add any addition debian packages that are needed such as leveldb.
See the Debian Backports section below.

Debian packages are signed when added to the repo, so no further action is
needed.


9.  Push repos to ceph.org
==========================

For a development release::

	rcp ceph-0.xx.tar.bz2 ceph-0.xx.tar.gz \
	     ceph_site@ceph.com:ceph.com/downloads/.
	rsync -av /tmp/rpm-repo/0.xx/ ceph_site@ceph.com:ceph.com/rpm-testing
	rsync -av /tmp/debian-repo/ ceph_site@ceph.com:ceph.com/debian-testing

For a stable release, replace {CODENAME} with the release codename (e.g., ``argonaut`` or ``bobtail``)::

        rcp ceph-0.xx.tar.bz2 \
            ceph_site@ceph.com:ceph.com/downloads/ceph-0.xx.tar.bz2
        rcp ceph-0.xx.tar.gz  \
            ceph_site@ceph.com:ceph.com/downloads/ceph-0.xx.tar.gz
        rsync -av /tmp/rpm-repo/0.xx/ ceph_site@ceph.com:ceph.com/rpm-{CODENAME}
        rsync -auv /tmp/debian-repo/ ceph_site@ceph.com:ceph.com/debian-{CODENAME}

10. Update Git
==============

Point release
-------------

For point releases just push the version number update to the
branch and the new tag::

    git push origin {codename}
    git push origin v0.xx

Development and Stable releases
-------------------------------

For a development release, update tags for ``ceph.git``::

    git push origin v0.xx
    git push origin HEAD:last
    git checkout master
    git merge next
    git push origin master
    git push origin HEAD:next

Similarly, for a development release, for both ``teuthology.git`` and ``ceph-qa-suite.git``::

    git checkout master
    git reset --hard origin/master
    git branch -f last origin/next
    git push -f origin last
    git push -f origin master:next
