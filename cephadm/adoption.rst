现有集群切换到 cephadm
======================
.. Converting an existing cluster to cephadm

It is possible to convert some existing clusters so that they can be managed
with ``cephadm``. This statment applies to some clusters that were deployed
with ``ceph-deploy``, ``ceph-ansible``, or ``DeepSea``.

This section of the documentation explains how to determine whether your
clusters can be converted to a state in which they can be managed by
``cephadm`` and how to perform those conversions.

局限性

.. Limitations

* Cephadm 仅适配 BlueStore OSDs；集群内的 FileStore OSDs 不能用 ``cephadm`` 管理。

Preparation
-----------

#. Make sure that the ``cephadm`` command line tool is available on each host
   in the existing cluster.  See :ref:`get-cephadm` to learn how.

#. Prepare each host for use by ``cephadm`` by running this command:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      cephadm prepare-host

#. Choose a version of Ceph to use for the conversion. This procedure will work
   with any release of Ceph that is Octopus (15.2.z) or later, inclusive.  The
   latest stable release of Ceph is the default. You might be upgrading from an
   earlier Ceph release at the same time that you're performing this
   conversion; if you are upgrading from an earlier release, make sure to
   follow any upgrade-releated instructions for that release.

   Pass the image to cephadm with the following command:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      cephadm --image $IMAGE <rest of command goes here>

   The conversion begins.

#. Confirm that the conversion is underway by running ``cephadm ls`` and
   making sure that the style of the daemons is changed:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      cephadm ls

   Before starting the converstion process, ``cephadm ls`` shows all existing
   daemons to have a style of ``legacy``. As the adoption process progresses,
   adopted daemons will appear with a style of ``cephadm:v1``.


Adoption process
----------------

#. Make sure that the ceph configuration has been migrated to use the cluster
   config database.  If the ``/etc/ceph/ceph.conf`` is identical on each host,
   then the following command can be run on one single host and will affect all
   hosts:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      ceph config assimilate-conf -i /etc/ceph/ceph.conf

   If there are configuration variations between hosts, you will need to repeat
   this command on each host. During this adoption process, view the cluster's
   configuration to confirm that it is complete by running the following
   command:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      ceph config dump

#. Adopt each monitor:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      cephadm adopt --style legacy --name mon.<hostname>

   Each legacy monitor should stop, quickly restart as a cephadm
   container, and rejoin the quorum.

#. Adopt each manager:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      cephadm adopt --style legacy --name mgr.<hostname>

#. Enable cephadm:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      ceph mgr module enable cephadm
      ceph orch set backend cephadm

#. Generate an SSH key:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      ceph cephadm generate-key
      ceph cephadm get-pub-key > ~/ceph.pub

#. Install the cluster SSH key on each host in the cluster:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      ssh-copy-id -f -i ~/ceph.pub root@<host>

   .. note::
     It is also possible to import an existing ssh key. See
     :ref:`ssh errors <cephadm-ssh-errors>` in the troubleshooting
     document for instructions that describe how to import existing
     ssh keys.

   .. note::
     It is also possible to have cephadm use a non-root user to ssh
     into cluster hosts. This user needs to have passwordless sudo access.
     Use ``ceph cephadm set-user <user>`` and copy the ssh key to that user.
     See :ref:`cephadm-ssh-user`

#. Tell cephadm which hosts to manage:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      ceph orch host add <hostname> [ip-address]

   This will perform a ``cephadm check-host`` on each host before adding it;
   this check ensures that the host is functioning properly. The IP address
   argument is recommended; if not provided, then the host name will be resolved
   via DNS.

#. Verify that the adopted monitor and manager daemons are visible:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      ceph orch ps

#. Adopt all OSDs in the cluster:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      cephadm adopt --style legacy --name <name>

   For example:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      cephadm adopt --style legacy --name osd.1
      cephadm adopt --style legacy --name osd.2

#. Redeploy MDS daemons by telling cephadm how many daemons to run for
   each file system. List file systems by name with the command ``ceph fs
   ls``. Run the following command on the master nodes to redeploy the MDS
   daemons:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      ceph orch apply mds <fs-name> [--placement=<placement>]

   For example, in a cluster with a single file system called `foo`:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      ceph fs ls

   .. code-block:: bash

      name: foo, metadata pool: foo_metadata, data pools: [foo_data ]

   .. prompt:: bash #

      ceph orch apply mds foo 2

   Confirm that the new MDS daemons have started:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      ceph orch ps --daemon-type mds

   Finally, stop and remove the legacy MDS daemons:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      systemctl stop ceph-mds.target
      rm -rf /var/lib/ceph/mds/ceph-*

#. Redeploy RGW daemons. Cephadm manages RGW daemons by zone. For each
   zone, deploy new RGW daemons with cephadm:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      ceph orch apply rgw <svc_id> [--realm=<realm>] [--zone=<zone>] [--port=<port>] [--ssl] [--placement=<placement>]

   where *<placement>* can be a simple daemon count, or a list of
   specific hosts (see :ref:`orchestrator-cli-placement-spec`), and the
   zone and realm arguments are needed only for a multisite setup.

   After the daemons have started and you have confirmed that they are
   functioning, stop and remove the old, legacy daemons:

   .. prompt:: bash #

      systemctl stop ceph-rgw.target
      rm -rf /var/lib/ceph/radosgw/ceph-*

#. Check the output of the command ``ceph health detail`` for cephadm warnings
   about stray cluster daemons or hosts that are not yet managed by cephadm.
