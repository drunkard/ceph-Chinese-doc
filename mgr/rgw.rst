RGW Module
============
The rgw module helps with bootstraping and configuring RGW realm
and the different related entities.

Enabling
--------

The *rgw* module is enabled with::

  ceph mgr module enable rgw


RGW Realm Operations
-----------------------

Bootstrapping RGW realm creates a new RGW realm entity, a new zonegroup,
and a new zone. It configures a new system user that can be used for
multisite sync operations, and returns a corresponding token. It sets
up new RGW instances via the orchestrator.

It is also possible to create a new zone that connects to the master
zone and synchronizes data to/from it.


Realm Credentials Token
-----------------------
A new token is created when bootstrapping a new realm, and also
when creating one explicitly.  The token encapsulates
the master zone endpoint, and a set of credentials that are associated
with a system user.
Removal of this token would remove the credentials, and if the corresponding
system user has no more access keys, it is removed.

  ceph rgw realm bootstrap
