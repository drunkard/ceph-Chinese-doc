ceph-mgr 模块开发指南
=====================

.. warning::

   这是开发者文档，所述的 Ceph 内部机制仅供 ceph-mgr 模块\
   开发者使用。

创建模块
--------
.. Creating a module

在 pybind/mgr/ 目录下，创建一个 python 模块，在此模块内创建\
一个继承 ``MgrModule`` 的类。为了让 ceph-mgr 能探测到你的\
模块，你的目录必须包含一个名为 `module.py` 的文件。

需要覆盖的、最重要的方法有：

* ``serve`` 成员函数，用于服务器类型的模块，此函数应该永远阻塞；
* ``notify`` 成员函数，如果你的模块想对新的集群数据有所动作；
* ``handle_command`` 成员函数，如果你的模块要暴露 CLI 命令。

Some modules interface with external orchestrators to deploy
Ceph services.  These also inherit from ``Orchestrator``, which adds
additional methods to the base ``MgrModule`` class.  See
:ref:`Orchestrator modules <orchestrator-modules>` for more on
creating these modules.


安装模块
--------
.. Installing a module

你自己的模块放入 ``mgr module path`` 配置选项所指的路径后，\
可以用 ``ceph mgr module enable`` 命令启用它： ::

  ceph mgr module enable mymodule

请注意， MgrModule 接口不稳定，所以 Ceph 树以外维护的模块用于\
较新或较低版本的 Ceph 时可能很容易崩溃。


日志记录
--------
.. Logging

Logging in Ceph manager modules is done as in any other Python program. Just
import the ``logging`` package and get a logger instance with the
``logging.getLogger`` function.

Each module has a ``log_level`` option that specifies the current Python
logging level of the module.
To change or query the logging level of the module use the following Ceph
commands::

  ceph config get mgr mgr/<module_name>/log_level
  ceph config set mgr mgr/<module_name>/log_level <info|debug|critical|error|warning|>

The logging level used upon the module's start is determined by the current
logging level of the mgr daemon, unless if the ``log_level`` option was
previously set with the ``config set ...`` command. The mgr daemon logging
level is mapped to the module python logging level as follows:

* <= 0 is CRITICAL
* <= 1 is WARNING
* <= 4 is INFO
* <= +inf is DEBUG

We can unset the module log level and fallback to the mgr daemon logging level
by running the following command::

  ceph config set mgr mgr/<module_name>/log_level ''

By default, modules' logging messages are processed by the Ceph logging layer
where they will be recorded in the mgr daemon's log file.
But it's also possible to send a module's logging message to it's own file.

The module's log file will be located in the same directory as the mgr daemon's
log file with the following name pattern::

   <mgr_daemon_log_file_name>.<module_name>.log

To enable the file logging on a module use the following command::

   ceph config set mgr mgr/<module_name>/log_to_file true

When the module's file logging is enabled, module's logging messages stop
being written to the mgr daemon's log file and are only written to the
module's log file.

It's also possible to check the status and disable the file logging with the
following commands::

   ceph config get mgr mgr/<module_name>/log_to_file
   ceph config set mgr mgr/<module_name>/log_to_file false



.. _mgr-module-exposing-commands:

Exposing commands
-----------------

There are two approaches for exposing a command. The first one is to
use the ``@CLICommand`` decorator to decorate the method which handles
the command. like this

.. code:: python

   @CLICommand('antigravity send to blackhole',
               perm='rw')
   def send_to_blackhole(self, oid: str, blackhole: Optional[str] = None, inbuf: Optional[str] = None):
       '''
       Send the specified object to black hole
       '''
       obj = self.find_object(oid)
       if obj is None:
           return HandleCommandResult(-errno.ENOENT, stderr=f"object '{oid}' not found")
       if blackhole is not None and inbuf is not None:
           try:
               location = self.decrypt(blackhole, passphrase=inbuf)
           except ValueError:
               return HandleCommandResult(-errno.EINVAL, stderr='unable to decrypt location')
       else:
           location = blackhole
       self.send_object_to(obj, location)
       return HandleCommandResult(stdout=f'the black hole swallowed '{oid}'")

The first parameter passed to ``CLICommand`` is the "name" of the command.
Since there are lots of commands in Ceph, we tend to group related commands
with a common prefix. In this case, "antigravity" is used for this purpose.
As the author is probably designing a module which is also able to launch
rockets into the deep space.

The `type annotations <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`_ for the
method parameters are mandatory here, so the usage of the command can be
properly reported to the ``ceph`` CLI, and the manager daemon can convert
the serialized command parameters sent by the clients to the expected type
before passing them to the handler method. With properly implemented types,
one can also perform some sanity checks against the parameters!

The names of the parameters are part of the command interface, so please
try to take the backward compatibility into consideration when changing
them. But you **cannot** change name of ``inbuf`` parameter, it is used
to pass the content of the file specified by ``ceph --in-file`` option.

The docstring of the method is used for the description of the command.

The manager daemon cooks the usage of the command from these ingredients,
like::

  antigravity send to blackhole <oid> [<blackhole>]  Send the specified object to black hole

as part of the output of ``ceph --help``.

In addition to ``@CLICommand``, you could also use ``@CLIReadCommand`` or
``@CLIWriteCommand`` if your command only requires read permissions or
write permissions respectively.

The second one is to set the ``COMMANDS`` class attribute of your module to
a list of dicts like this::

    COMMANDS = [
        {
            "cmd": "foobar name=myarg,type=CephString",
            "desc": "Do something awesome",
            "perm": "rw",
            # optional:
            "poll": "true"
        }
    ]

The ``cmd`` part of each entry is parsed in the same way as internal
Ceph mon and admin socket commands (see mon/MonCommands.h in
the Ceph source for examples). Note that the "poll" field is optional,
and is set to False by default; this indicates to the ``ceph`` CLI
that it should call this command repeatedly and output results (see
``ceph -h`` and its ``--period`` option).

Each command is expected to return a tuple ``(retval, stdout, stderr)``.
``retval`` is an integer representing a libc error code (e.g. EINVAL,
EPERM, or 0 for no error), ``stdout`` is a string containing any
non-error output, and ``stderr`` is a string containing any progress or
error explanation output.  Either or both of the two strings may be empty.

Implement the ``handle_command`` function to respond to the commands
when they are sent:

.. py:currentmodule:: mgr_module
.. automethod:: MgrModule.handle_command


配置选项
--------
.. Configuration options

Modules can load and store configuration options using the
``set_module_option`` and ``get_module_option`` methods.

.. note:: Use ``set_module_option`` and ``get_module_option`` to
   manage user-visible configuration options that are not blobs (like
   certificates). If you want to persist module-internal data or
   binary configuration data consider using the `KV store`_.

You must declare your available configuration options in the
``MODULE_OPTIONS`` class attribute, like this:

::

    MODULE_OPTIONS = [
        {
            "name": "my_option"
        }
    ]

If you try to use set_module_option or get_module_option on options not declared
in ``MODULE_OPTIONS``, an exception will be raised.

You may choose to provide setter commands in your module to perform
high level validation.  Users can also modify configuration using
the normal `ceph config set` command, where the configuration options
for a mgr module are named like `mgr/<module name>/<option>`.

If a configuration option is different depending on which node the mgr
is running on, then use *localized* configuration (
``get_localized_module_option``, ``set_localized_module_option``).
This may be necessary for options such as what address to listen on.
Localized options may also be set externally with ``ceph config set``,
where they key name is like ``mgr/<module name>/<mgr id>/<option>``

If you need to load and store data (e.g. something larger, binary, or multiline),
use the KV store instead of configuration options (see next section).

Hints for using config options:

* Reads are fast: ceph-mgr keeps a local in-memory copy, so in many cases
  you can just do a get_module_option every time you use a option, rather than
  copying it out into a variable.
* Writes block until the value is persisted (i.e. round trip to the monitor),
  but reads from another thread will see the new value immediately.
* If a user has used `config set` from the command line, then the new
  value will become visible to `get_module_option` immediately, although the
  mon->mgr update is asynchronous, so `config set` will return a fraction
  of a second before the new value is visible on the mgr.
* To delete a config value (i.e. revert to default), just pass ``None`` to
  set_module_option.

.. automethod:: MgrModule.get_module_option
.. automethod:: MgrModule.set_module_option
.. automethod:: MgrModule.get_localized_module_option
.. automethod:: MgrModule.set_localized_module_option


KV store
--------

Modules have access to a private (per-module) key value store, which
is implemented using the monitor's "config-key" commands.  Use
the ``set_store`` and ``get_store`` methods to access the KV store from
your module.

The KV store commands work in a similar way to the configuration
commands.  Reads are fast, operating from a local cache.  Writes block
on persistence and do a round trip to the monitor.

This data can be access from outside of ceph-mgr using the
``ceph config-key [get|set]`` commands.  Key names follow the same
conventions as configuration options.  Note that any values updated
from outside of ceph-mgr will not be seen by running modules until
the next restart.  Users should be discouraged from accessing module KV
data externally -- if it is necessary for users to populate data, modules
should provide special commands to set the data via the module.

Use the ``get_store_prefix`` function to enumerate keys within
a particular prefix (i.e. all keys starting with a particular substring).


.. automethod:: MgrModule.get_store
.. automethod:: MgrModule.set_store
.. automethod:: MgrModule.get_localized_store
.. automethod:: MgrModule.set_localized_store
.. automethod:: MgrModule.get_store_prefix


.. Accessing cluster data

访问集群数据
------------

Modules have access to the in-memory copies of the Ceph cluster's
state that the mgr maintains.  Accessor functions as exposed
as members of MgrModule.

Calls that access the cluster or daemon state are generally going
from Python into native C++ routines.  There is some overhead to this,
but much less than for example calling into a REST API or calling into
an SQL database.

There are no consistency rules about access to cluster structures or
daemon metadata.  For example, an OSD might exist in OSDMap but
have no metadata, or vice versa.  On a healthy cluster these
will be very rare transient states, but modules should be written
to cope with the possibility.

Note that these accessors must not be called in the modules ``__init__``
function. This will result in a circular locking exception.

.. automethod:: MgrModule.get
.. automethod:: MgrModule.get_server
.. automethod:: MgrModule.list_servers
.. automethod:: MgrModule.get_metadata
.. automethod:: MgrModule.get_daemon_status
.. automethod:: MgrModule.get_perf_schema
.. automethod:: MgrModule.get_counter
.. automethod:: MgrModule.get_mgr_id


.. Exposing health checks

暴露给健康检查
--------------

Modules can raise first class Ceph health checks, which will be reported
in the output of ``ceph status`` and in other places that report on the
cluster's health.

If you use ``set_health_checks`` to report a problem, be sure to call
it again with an empty dict to clear your health check when the problem
goes away.

.. automethod:: MgrModule.set_health_checks


.. What if the mons are down?

监视器挂了怎么办？
------------------

The manager daemon gets much of its state (such as the cluster maps)
from the monitor.  If the monitor cluster is inaccessible, whichever
manager was active will continue to run, with the latest state it saw
still in memory.

However, if you are creating a module that shows the cluster state
to the user then you may well not want to mislead them by showing
them that out of date state.

To check if the manager daemon currently has a connection to
the monitor cluster, use this function:

.. automethod:: MgrModule.have_mon_connection


.. Reporting if your module cannot run

在模块不可运行时报告
--------------------

If your module cannot be run for any reason (such as a missing dependency),
then you can report that by implementing the ``can_run`` function.

.. automethod:: MgrModule.can_run

Note that this will only work properly if your module can always be imported:
if you are importing a dependency that may be absent, then do it in a
try/except block so that your module can be loaded far enough to use
``can_run`` even if the dependency is absent.


.. Sending commands

发出命令
--------

A non-blocking facility is provided for sending monitor commands
to the cluster.

.. automethod:: MgrModule.send_command


.. Receiving notifications

接收通知
--------

The manager daemon calls the ``notify`` function on all active modules
when certain important pieces of cluster state are updated, such as the
cluster maps.

The actual data is not passed into this function, rather it is a cue for
the module to go and read the relevant structure if it is interested.  Most
modules ignore most types of notification: to ignore a notification
simply return from this function without doing anything.

.. automethod:: MgrModule.notify


.. Accessing RADOS or CephFS

访问 RADOS 或 CephFS
--------------------

If you want to use the librados python API to access data stored in
the Ceph cluster, you can access the ``rados`` attribute of your
``MgrModule`` instance.  This is an instance of ``rados.Rados`` which
has been constructed for you using the existing Ceph context (an internal
detail of the C++ Ceph code) of the mgr daemon.

Always use this specially constructed librados instance instead of
constructing one by hand.

Similarly, if you are using libcephfs to access the file system, then
use the libcephfs ``create_with_rados`` to construct it from the
``MgrModule.rados`` librados instance, and thereby inherit the correct context.

Remember that your module may be running while other parts of the cluster
are down: do not assume that librados or libcephfs calls will return
promptly -- consider whether to use timeouts or to block if the rest of
the cluster is not fully available.

.. Implementing standby mode

备用模式的实现
--------------

For some modules, it is useful to run on standby manager daemons as well
as on the active daemon.  For example, an HTTP server can usefully
serve HTTP redirect responses from the standby managers so that
the user can point his browser at any of the manager daemons without
having to worry about which one is active.

Standby manager daemons look for a subclass of ``StandbyModule``
in each module.  If the class is not found then the module is not
used at all on standby daemons.  If the class is found, then
its ``serve`` method is called.  Implementations of ``StandbyModule``
must inherit from ``mgr_module.MgrStandbyModule``.

The interface of ``MgrStandbyModule`` is much restricted compared to
``MgrModule`` -- none of the Ceph cluster state is available to
the module.  ``serve`` and ``shutdown`` methods are used in the same
way as a normal module class.  The ``get_active_uri`` method enables
the standby module to discover the address of its active peer in
order to make redirects.  See the ``MgrStandbyModule`` definition
in the Ceph source code for the full list of methods.

For an example of how to use this interface, look at the source code
of the ``dashboard`` module.

.. Communicating between modules

模块间通信
----------

Modules can invoke member functions of other modules.

.. automethod:: MgrModule.remote

Be sure to handle ``ImportError`` to deal with the case that the desired
module is not enabled.

If the remote method raises a python exception, this will be converted
to a RuntimeError on the calling side, where the message string describes
the exception that was originally thrown.  If your logic intends
to handle certain errors cleanly, it is better to modify the remote method
to return an error value instead of raising an exception.

At time of writing, inter-module calls are implemented without
copies or serialization, so when you return a python object, you're 
returning a reference to that object to the calling module.  It
is recommend *not* to rely on this reference passing, as in future the
implementation may change to serialize arguments and return
values.


.. Shutting down cleanly

干净地关闭
----------

If a module implements the ``serve()`` method, it should also implement
the ``shutdown()`` method to shutdown cleanly: misbehaving modules
may otherwise prevent clean shutdown of ceph-mgr.


.. Limitations

局限性
------

It is not possible to call back into C++ code from a module's
``__init__()`` method.  For example calling ``self.get_module_option()`` at
this point will result in an assertion failure in ceph-mgr.  For modules
that implement the ``serve()`` method, it usually makes sense to do most
initialization inside that method instead.


.. Is something missing?

还有未竟事宜否？
----------------

The ceph-mgr python interface is not set in stone.  If you have a need
that is not satisfied by the current interface, please bring it up
on the ceph-devel mailing list.  While it is desired to avoid bloating
the interface, it is not generally very hard to expose existing data
to the Python code when there is a good reason.
