Ceph 集群可能产生的健康消息是有限的——它们通通被定义为\
*健康检查*\ ，都有唯一标识符。

The identifier is a terse pseudo-human-readable (i.e. like a variable name)
string.  It is intended to enable tools (such as UIs) to make sense of
health checks, and present them in a way that reflects their meaning.

This page lists the health checks that are raised by the monitor and manager
daemons.  In addition to these, you may also see health checks that originate
from MDS daemons (see :ref:`cephfs-health-messages`), and health checks
that are defined by ceph-mgr python modules.

DAEMON_OLD_VERSION
__________________

Warn if old version(s) of Ceph are running on any daemons.
It will generate a health error if multiple versions are detected.
This condition must exist for over mon_warn_older_version_delay (set to 1 week by default) in order for the
health condition to be triggered.  This allows most upgrades to proceed
without falsely seeing the warning.  If upgrade is paused for an extended
time period, health mute can be used like this
"ceph health mute DAEMON_OLD_VERSION --sticky".  In this case after
upgrade has finished use "ceph health unmute DAEMON_OLD_VERSION".

MON_DOWN
________

One or more monitor daemons is currently down.  The cluster requires a
majority (more than 1/2) of the monitors in order to function.  When
one or more monitors are down, clients may have a harder time forming
their initial connection to the cluster as they may need to try more
addresses before they reach an operating monitor.

The down monitor daemon should generally be restarted as soon as
possible to reduce the risk of a subsequen monitor failure leading to
a service outage.

MON_CLOCK_SKEW
______________

The clocks on the hosts running the ceph-mon monitor daemons are not
sufficiently well synchronized.  This health alert is raised if the
cluster detects a clock skew greater than ``mon_clock_drift_allowed``.

This is best resolved by synchronizing the clocks using a tool like
``ntpd`` or ``chrony``.

If it is impractical to keep the clocks closely synchronized, the
``mon_clock_drift_allowed`` threshold can also be increased, but this
value must stay significantly below the ``mon_lease`` interval in
order for monitor cluster to function properly.

MON_MSGR2_NOT_ENABLED
_____________________

The :confval:`ms_bind_msgr2` option is enabled but one or more monitors is
not configured to bind to a v2 port in the cluster's monmap.  This
means that features specific to the msgr2 protocol (e.g., encryption)
are not available on some or all connections.

In most cases this can be corrected by issuing the command::

  ceph mon enable-msgr2

That command will change any monitor configured for the old default
port 6789 to continue to listen for v1 connections on 6789 and also
listen for v2 connections on the new default 3300 port.

If a monitor is configured to listen for v1 connections on a non-standard port (not 6789), then the monmap will need to be modified manually.


MON_DISK_LOW
____________

One or more monitors is low on disk space.  This alert triggers if the
available space on the file system storing the monitor database
(normally ``/var/lib/ceph/mon``), as a percentage, drops below
``mon_data_avail_warn`` (default: 30%).

This may indicate that some other process or user on the system is
filling up the same file system used by the monitor.  It may also
indicate that the monitors database is large (see ``MON_DISK_BIG``
below).

If space cannot be freed, the monitor's data directory may need to be
moved to another storage device or file system (while the monitor
daemon is not running, of course).


MON_DISK_CRIT
_____________

One or more monitors is critically low on disk space.  This alert
triggers if the available space on the file system storing the monitor
database (normally ``/var/lib/ceph/mon``), as a percentage, drops
below ``mon_data_avail_crit`` (default: 5%).  See ``MON_DISK_LOW``, above.

MON_DISK_BIG
____________

The database size for one or more monitors is very large.  This alert
triggers if the size of the monitor's database is larger than
``mon_data_size_warn`` (default: 15 GiB).

A large database is unusual, but may not necessarily indicate a
problem.  Monitor databases may grow in size when there are placement
groups that have not reached an ``active+clean`` state in a long time.

This may also indicate that the monitor's database is not properly
compacting, which has been observed with some older versions of
leveldb and rocksdb.  Forcing a compaction with ``ceph daemon mon.<id>
compact`` may shrink the on-disk size.

This warning may also indicate that the monitor has a bug that is
preventing it from pruning the cluster metadata it stores.  If the
problem persists, please report a bug.

The warning threshold may be adjusted with::

  ceph config set global mon_data_size_warn <size>

AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM
_______________________________

One or more clients or daemons are connected to the cluster that are
not securely reclaiming their global_id (a unique number identifying
each entity in the cluster) when reconnecting to a monitor.  The
client is being permitted to connect anyway because the
``auth_allow_insecure_global_id_reclaim`` option is set to true (which may
be necessary until all ceph clients have been upgraded), and the
``auth_expose_insecure_global_id_reclaim`` option set to ``true`` (which
allows monitors to detect clients with insecure reclaim early by forcing them to
reconnect right after they first authenticate).

You can identify which client(s) are using unpatched ceph client code with::

  ceph health detail

Clients global_id reclaim rehavior can also seen in the
``global_id_status`` field in the dump of clients connected to an
individual monitor (``reclaim_insecure`` means the client is
unpatched and is contributing to this health alert)::

  ceph tell mon.\* sessions

We strongly recommend that all clients in the system are upgraded to a
newer version of Ceph that correctly reclaims global_id values.  Once
all clients have been updated, you can stop allowing insecure reconnections
with::

  ceph config set mon auth_allow_insecure_global_id_reclaim false

If it is impractical to upgrade all clients immediately, you can silence
this warning temporarily with::

  ceph health mute AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM 1w   # 1 week

Although we do NOT recommend doing so, you can also disable this warning indefinitely
with::

  ceph config set mon mon_warn_on_insecure_global_id_reclaim false

AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM_ALLOWED
_______________________________________

Ceph is currently configured to allow clients to reconnect to monitors using
an insecure process to reclaim their previous global_id because the setting
``auth_allow_insecure_global_id_reclaim`` is set to ``true``.  It may be necessary to
leave this setting enabled while existing Ceph clients are upgraded to newer
versions of Ceph that correctly and securely reclaim their global_id.

If the ``AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM`` health alert has not also been raised and
the ``auth_expose_insecure_global_id_reclaim`` setting has not been disabled (it is
on by default), then there are currently no clients connected that need to be
upgraded, and it is safe to disallow insecure global_id reclaim with::

  ceph config set mon auth_allow_insecure_global_id_reclaim false

If there are still clients that need to be upgraded, then this alert can be
silenced temporarily with::

  ceph health mute AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM_ALLOWED 1w   # 1 week

Although we do NOT recommend doing so, you can also disable this warning indefinitely
with::

  ceph config set mon mon_warn_on_insecure_global_id_reclaim_allowed false


管理器
------
.. Manager

MGR_DOWN
________

All manager daemons are currently down.  The cluster should normally
have at least one running manager (``ceph-mgr``) daemon.  If no
manager daemon is running, the cluster's ability to monitor itself will
be compromised, and parts of the management API will become
unavailable (for example, the dashboard will not work, and most CLI
commands that report metrics or runtime state will block).  However,
the cluster will still be able to perform all IO operations and
recover from failures.

The down manager daemon should generally be restarted as soon as
possible to ensure that the cluster can be monitored (e.g., so that
the ``ceph -s`` information is up to date, and/or metrics can be
scraped by Prometheus).


MGR_MODULE_DEPENDENCY
_____________________

An enabled manager module is failing its dependency check.  This health check
should come with an explanatory message from the module about the problem.

For example, a module might report that a required package is not installed:
install the required package and restart your manager daemons.

This health check is only applied to enabled modules.  If a module is
not enabled, you can see whether it is reporting dependency issues in
the output of `ceph module ls`.


MGR_MODULE_ERROR
________________

A manager module has experienced an unexpected error.  Typically,
this means an unhandled exception was raised from the module's `serve`
function.  The human readable description of the error may be obscurely
worded if the exception did not provide a useful description of itself.

This health check may indicate a bug: please open a Ceph bug report if you
think you have encountered a bug.

If you believe the error is transient, you may restart your manager
daemon(s), or use `ceph mgr fail` on the active daemon to prompt
a failover to another daemon.


OSDs
----

OSD_DOWN
________

至少有一个 OSD 被标记成了 down 状态，其 ceph-osd 守护进程可能\
已经停掉了、或者是对端 OSD 与此 OSD 之间的网络不通。常见起因有\
守护进程停止或崩溃、主机挂了、或者网络中断。

核实一下此主机是否健康、守护进程是否启动、网络是否正常。如果\
那个守护进程崩溃了，其守护进程日志文件（
``/var/log/ceph/ceph-osd.*`` ）里会包含调试信息。

OSD_<crush type>_DOWN
_____________________

(例如 OSD_HOST_DOWN, OSD_ROOT_DOWN)

某一个 CRUSH 子树里的所有 OSD 都被标记成 down 了，例如一台主机\
上的所有 OSD 。

OSD_ORPHAN
__________

CRUSH 图分级结构里提到了这个 OSD ，但它并不存在。

CRUSH 图分级结构里的这个 OSD 可以用以下命令删除： ::

  ceph osd crush rm osd.<id>

OSD_OUT_OF_ORDER_FULL
_____________________

The utilization thresholds for `nearfull`, `backfillfull`, `full`,
and/or `failsafe_full` are not ascending.  In particular, we expect
`nearfull < backfillfull`, `backfillfull < full`, and `full <
failsafe_full`.

The thresholds can be adjusted with::

  ceph osd set-nearfull-ratio <ratio>
  ceph osd set-backfillfull-ratio <ratio>
  ceph osd set-full-ratio <ratio>


OSD_FULL
________

One or more OSDs has exceeded the `full` threshold and is preventing
the cluster from servicing writes.

Utilization by pool can be checked with::

  ceph df

The currently defined `full` ratio can be seen with::

  ceph osd dump | grep full_ratio

A short-term workaround to restore write availability is to raise the full
threshold by a small amount::

  ceph osd set-full-ratio <ratio>

New storage should be added to the cluster by deploying more OSDs or
existing data should be deleted in order to free up space.

OSD_BACKFILLFULL
________________

One or more OSDs has exceeded the `backfillfull` threshold, which will
prevent data from being allowed to rebalance to this device.  This is
an early warning that rebalancing may not be able to complete and that
the cluster is approaching full.

Utilization by pool can be checked with::

  ceph df

OSD_NEARFULL
____________

One or more OSDs has exceeded the `nearfull` threshold.  This is an early
warning that the cluster is approaching full.

Utilization by pool can be checked with::

  ceph df

OSDMAP_FLAGS
____________

One or more cluster flags of interest has been set.  These flags include:

* *full* - the cluster is flagged as full and cannot serve writes
* *pauserd*, *pausewr* - paused reads or writes
* *noup* - OSDs are not allowed to start
* *nodown* - OSD failure reports are being ignored, such that the
  monitors will not mark OSDs `down`
* *noin* - OSDs that were previously marked `out` will not be marked
  back `in` when they start
* *noout* - down OSDs will not automatically be marked out after the
  configured interval
* *nobackfill*, *norecover*, *norebalance* - recovery or data
  rebalancing is suspended
* *noscrub*, *nodeep_scrub* - scrubbing is disabled
* *notieragent* - cache tiering activity is suspended

With the exception of *full*, these flags can be set or cleared with::

  ceph osd set <flag>
  ceph osd unset <flag>

OSD_FLAGS
_________

One or more OSDs or CRUSH {nodes,device classes} has a flag of interest set.
These flags include:

* *noup*: these OSDs are not allowed to start
* *nodown*: failure reports for these OSDs will be ignored
* *noin*: if these OSDs were previously marked `out` automatically
  after a failure, they will not be marked in when they start
* *noout*: if these OSDs are down they will not automatically be marked
  `out` after the configured interval

这些标记可以这样批量设置和清除： ::

  ceph osd set-group <flags> <who>
  ceph osd unset-group <flags> <who>

例如： ::

  ceph osd set-group noup,noout osd.0 osd.1
  ceph osd unset-group noup,noout osd.0 osd.1
  ceph osd set-group noup,noout host-foo
  ceph osd unset-group noup,noout host-foo
  ceph osd set-group noup,noout class-hdd
  ceph osd unset-group noup,noout class-hdd

OLD_CRUSH_TUNABLES
__________________

CRUSH 图在使用很老的选项，应该更新它。还能使用（即，可连接此\
集群的最老客户端版本号）而不会触发此健康告警的最老可调选项由
``mon_crush_min_required_version`` 配置选项决定。
详情见 ref:`crush-map-tunables` 。

OLD_CRUSH_STRAW_CALC_VERSION
____________________________

CRUSH 图在使用一个比较老的、非最优方法为 ``straw`` 桶计算中间权重值。

The CRUSH map should be updated to use the newer method
(``straw_calc_version=1``).  See
:ref:`crush-map-tunables` for more information.

CACHE_POOL_NO_HIT_SET
_____________________

One or more cache pools is not configured with a *hit set* to track
utilization, which will prevent the tiering agent from identifying
cold objects to flush and evict from the cache.

Hit sets can be configured on the cache pool with::

  ceph osd pool set <poolname> hit_set_type <type>
  ceph osd pool set <poolname> hit_set_period <period-in-seconds>
  ceph osd pool set <poolname> hit_set_count <number-of-hitsets>
  ceph osd pool set <poolname> hit_set_fpp <target-false-positive-rate>

OSD_NO_SORTBITWISE
__________________

没有在跑 luminous v12.y.z 之前的 OSD ，但却没有设置 ``sortbitwise`` 标记。

The ``sortbitwise`` flag must be set before luminous v12.y.z or newer
OSDs can start.  You can safely set the flag with::

  ceph osd set sortbitwise

OSD_FILESTORE
__________________

Filestore has been deprecated, considering that Bluestore has been the default
objectstore for quite some time. Warn if OSDs are running Filestore.

The 'mclock_scheduler' is not supported for filestore OSDs. Therefore, the
default 'osd_op_queue' is set to 'wpq' for filestore OSDs and is enforced
even if the user attempts to change it.

Filestore OSDs can be listed with::

  ceph report | jq -c '."osd_metadata" | .[] | select(.osd_objectstore | contains("filestore")) | {id, osd_objectstore}'

If it is not feasible to migrate Filestore OSDs to Bluestore immediately, you can silence
this warning temporarily with::

  ceph health mute OSD_FILESTORE

POOL_FULL
_________

One or more pools has reached its quota and is no longer allowing writes.

Pool quotas and utilization can be seen with::

  ceph df detail

You can either raise the pool quota with::

  ceph osd pool set-quota <poolname> max_objects <num-objects>
  ceph osd pool set-quota <poolname> max_bytes <num-bytes>

or delete some existing data to reduce utilization.

BLUEFS_SPILLOVER
________________

One or more OSDs that use the BlueStore backend have been allocated
`db` partitions (storage space for metadata, normally on a faster
device) but that space has filled, such that metadata has "spilled
over" onto the normal slow device.  This isn't necessarily an error
condition or even unexpected, but if the administrator's expectation
was that all metadata would fit on the faster device, it indicates
that not enough space was provided.

This warning can be disabled on all OSDs with::

  ceph config set osd bluestore_warn_on_bluefs_spillover false

Alternatively, it can be disabled on a specific OSD with::

  ceph config set osd.123 bluestore_warn_on_bluefs_spillover false

To provide more metadata space, the OSD in question could be destroyed and
reprovisioned.  This will involve data migration and recovery.

It may also be possible to expand the LVM logical volume backing the
`db` storage.  If the underlying LV has been expanded, the OSD daemon
needs to be stopped and BlueFS informed of the device size change with::

  ceph-bluestore-tool bluefs-bdev-expand --path /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-$ID

BLUEFS_AVAILABLE_SPACE
______________________

To check how much space is free for BlueFS do::

  ceph daemon osd.123 bluestore bluefs available

This will output up to 3 values: `BDEV_DB free`, `BDEV_SLOW free` and
`available_from_bluestore`. `BDEV_DB` and `BDEV_SLOW` report amount of space that
has been acquired by BlueFS and is considered free. Value `available_from_bluestore`
denotes ability of BlueStore to relinquish more space to BlueFS.
It is normal that this value is different from amount of BlueStore free space, as
BlueFS allocation unit is typically larger than BlueStore allocation unit.
This means that only part of BlueStore free space will be acceptable for BlueFS.

BLUEFS_LOW_SPACE
_________________

If BlueFS is running low on available free space and there is little
`available_from_bluestore` one can consider reducing BlueFS allocation unit size.
To simulate available space when allocation unit is different do::

  ceph daemon osd.123 bluestore bluefs available <alloc-unit-size>

BLUESTORE_FRAGMENTATION
_______________________

As BlueStore works free space on underlying storage will get fragmented.
This is normal and unavoidable but excessive fragmentation will cause slowdown.
To inspect BlueStore fragmentation one can do::

  ceph daemon osd.123 bluestore allocator score block

Score is given in [0-1] range.
[0.0 .. 0.4] tiny fragmentation
[0.4 .. 0.7] small, acceptable fragmentation
[0.7 .. 0.9] considerable, but safe fragmentation
[0.9 .. 1.0] severe fragmentation, may impact BlueFS ability to get space from BlueStore

If detailed report of free fragments is required do::

  ceph daemon osd.123 bluestore allocator dump block

In case when handling OSD process that is not running fragmentation can be
inspected with `ceph-bluestore-tool`.
Get fragmentation score::

  ceph-bluestore-tool --path /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-123 --allocator block free-score

And dump detailed free chunks::

  ceph-bluestore-tool --path /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-123 --allocator block free-dump

BLUESTORE_LEGACY_STATFS
_______________________

In the Nautilus release, BlueStore tracks its internal usage
statistics on a per-pool granular basis, and one or more OSDs have
BlueStore volumes that were created prior to Nautilus.  If *all* OSDs
are older than Nautilus, this just means that the per-pool metrics are
not available.  However, if there is a mix of pre-Nautilus and
post-Nautilus OSDs, the cluster usage statistics reported by ``ceph
df`` will not be accurate.

The old OSDs can be updated to use the new usage tracking scheme by stopping each OSD, running a repair operation, and the restarting it.  For example, if ``osd.123`` needed to be updated,::

  systemctl stop ceph-osd@123
  ceph-bluestore-tool repair --path /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-123
  systemctl start ceph-osd@123

此警报可以这样禁用::

  ceph config set global bluestore_warn_on_legacy_statfs false

BLUESTORE_NO_PER_POOL_OMAP
__________________________

Starting with the Octopus release, BlueStore tracks omap space utilization
by pool, and one or more OSDs have volumes that were created prior to
Octopus.  If all OSDs are not running BlueStore with the new tracking
enabled, the cluster will report and approximate value for per-pool omap usage
based on the most recent deep-scrub.

The old OSDs can be updated to track by pool by stopping each OSD,
running a repair operation, and the restarting it.  For example, if
``osd.123`` needed to be updated,::

  systemctl stop ceph-osd@123
  ceph-bluestore-tool repair --path /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-123
  systemctl start ceph-osd@123

此警报可以这样禁用::

  ceph config set global bluestore_warn_on_no_per_pool_omap false

BLUESTORE_NO_PER_PG_OMAP
__________________________

Starting with the Pacific release, BlueStore tracks omap space utilization
by PG, and one or more OSDs have volumes that were created prior to
Pacific.  Per-PG omap enables faster PG removal when PGs migrate.

The older OSDs can be updated to track by PG by stopping each OSD,
running a repair operation, and the restarting it.  For example, if
``osd.123`` needed to be updated,::

  systemctl stop ceph-osd@123
  ceph-bluestore-tool repair --path /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-123
  systemctl start ceph-osd@123

此警报可以这样禁用::

  ceph config set global bluestore_warn_on_no_per_pg_omap false

BLUESTORE_DISK_SIZE_MISMATCH
____________________________

One or more OSDs using BlueStore has an internal inconsistency between the size
of the physical device and the metadata tracking its size.  This can lead to
the OSD crashing in the future.

The OSDs in question should be destroyed and reprovisioned.  Care should be
taken to do this one OSD at a time, and in a way that doesn't put any data at
risk.  For example, if osd ``$N`` has the error,::

  ceph osd out osd.$N
  while ! ceph osd safe-to-destroy osd.$N ; do sleep 1m ; done
  ceph osd destroy osd.$N
  ceph-volume lvm zap /path/to/device
  ceph-volume lvm create --osd-id $N --data /path/to/device

BLUESTORE_NO_COMPRESSION
________________________

One or more OSDs is unable to load a BlueStore compression plugin.
This can be caused by a broken installation, in which the ``ceph-osd``
binary does not match the compression plugins, or a recent upgrade
that did not include a restart of the ``ceph-osd`` daemon.

Verify that the package(s) on the host running the OSD(s) in question
are correctly installed and that the OSD daemon(s) have been
restarted.  If the problem persists, check the OSD log for any clues
as to the source of the problem.

BLUESTORE_SPURIOUS_READ_ERRORS
______________________________

One or more OSDs using BlueStore detects spurious read errors at main device.
BlueStore has recovered from these errors by retrying disk reads.
Though this might show some issues with underlying hardware, I/O subsystem,
etc.
Which theoretically might cause permanent data corruption.
Some observations on the root cause can be found at 
https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/22464

This alert doesn't require immediate response but corresponding host might need
additional attention, e.g. upgrading to the latest OS/kernel versions and
H/W resource utilization monitoring.

This warning can be disabled on all OSDs with::

  ceph config set osd bluestore_warn_on_spurious_read_errors false

Alternatively, it can be disabled on a specific OSD with::

  ceph config set osd.123 bluestore_warn_on_spurious_read_errors false


设备健康
--------
.. Device health

DEVICE_HEALTH
_____________

One or more devices is expected to fail soon, where the warning
threshold is controlled by the ``mgr/devicehealth/warn_threshold``
config option.

This warning only applies to OSDs that are currently marked "in", so
the expected response to this failure is to mark the device "out" so
that data is migrated off of the device, and then to remove the
hardware from the system.  Note that the marking out is normally done
automatically if ``mgr/devicehealth/self_heal`` is enabled based on
the ``mgr/devicehealth/mark_out_threshold``.

Device health can be checked with::

  ceph device info <device-id>

Device life expectancy is set by a prediction model run by
the mgr or an by external tool via the command::

  ceph device set-life-expectancy <device-id> <from> <to>

You can change the stored life expectancy manually, but that usually
doesn't accomplish anything as whatever tool originally set it will
probably set it again, and changing the stored value does not affect
the actual health of the hardware device.

DEVICE_HEALTH_IN_USE
____________________

One or more devices is expected to fail soon and has been marked "out"
of the cluster based on ``mgr/devicehealth/mark_out_threshold``, but it
is still participating in one more PGs.  This may be because it was
only recently marked "out" and data is still migrating, or because data
cannot be migrated off for some reason (e.g., the cluster is nearly
full, or the CRUSH hierarchy is such that there isn't another suitable
OSD to migrate the data too).

This message can be silenced by disabling the self heal behavior
(setting ``mgr/devicehealth/self_heal`` to false), by adjusting the
``mgr/devicehealth/mark_out_threshold``, or by addressing what is
preventing data from being migrated off of the ailing device.

DEVICE_HEALTH_TOOMANY
_____________________

Too many devices is expected to fail soon and the
``mgr/devicehealth/self_heal`` behavior is enabled, such that marking
out all of the ailing devices would exceed the clusters
``mon_osd_min_in_ratio`` ratio that prevents too many OSDs from being
automatically marked "out".

This generally indicates that too many devices in your cluster are
expected to fail soon and you should take action to add newer
(healthier) devices before too many devices fail and data is lost.

The health message can also be silenced by adjusting parameters like
``mon_osd_min_in_ratio`` or ``mgr/devicehealth/mark_out_threshold``,
but be warned that this will increase the likelihood of unrecoverable
data loss in the cluster.


数据健康（存储池和归置组们）
----------------------------
.. Data health (pools & placement groups)

PG_AVAILABILITY
_______________

Data availability is reduced, meaning that the cluster is unable to
service potential read or write requests for some data in the cluster.
Specifically, one or more PGs is in a state that does not allow IO
requests to be serviced.  Problematic PG states include *peering*,
*stale*, *incomplete*, and the lack of *active* (if those conditions do not clear
quickly).

Detailed information about which PGs are affected is available from::

  ceph health detail

In most cases the root cause is that one or more OSDs is currently
down; see the discussion for ``OSD_DOWN`` above.

The state of specific problematic PGs can be queried with::

  ceph tell <pgid> query

PG_DEGRADED
___________

Data redundancy is reduced for some data, meaning the cluster does not
have the desired number of replicas for all data (for replicated
pools) or erasure code fragments (for erasure coded pools).
Specifically, one or more PGs:

* has the *degraded* or *undersized* flag set, meaning there are not
  enough instances of that placement group in the cluster;
* has not had the *clean* flag set for some time.

Detailed information about which PGs are affected is available from::

  ceph health detail

In most cases the root cause is that one or more OSDs is currently
down; see the dicussion for ``OSD_DOWN`` above.

The state of specific problematic PGs can be queried with::

  ceph tell <pgid> query


PG_RECOVERY_FULL
________________

Data redundancy may be reduced or at risk for some data due to a lack
of free space in the cluster.  Specifically, one or more PGs has the
*recovery_toofull* flag set, meaning that the
cluster is unable to migrate or recover data because one or more OSDs
is above the *full* threshold.

See the discussion for *OSD_FULL* above for steps to resolve this condition.

PG_BACKFILL_FULL
________________

Data redundancy may be reduced or at risk for some data due to a lack
of free space in the cluster.  Specifically, one or more PGs has the
*backfill_toofull* flag set, meaning that the
cluster is unable to migrate or recover data because one or more OSDs
is above the *backfillfull* threshold.

See the discussion for *OSD_BACKFILLFULL* above for
steps to resolve this condition.

PG_DAMAGED
__________

Data scrubbing has discovered some problems with data consistency in
the cluster.  Specifically, one or more PGs has the *inconsistent* or
*snaptrim_error* flag is set, indicating an earlier scrub operation
found a problem, or that the *repair* flag is set, meaning a repair
for such an inconsistency is currently in progress.

When a read error occurs and another replica is available it is used to repair
the error immediately, so that the client can get the object data.  Scrub
handles errors for data at rest.  In order to identify possible failing disks
that aren't seeing scrub errors, a count of read repairs is maintained.  If
it exceeds a config value threshold *mon_osd_warn_num_repaired* default 10,
this health warning is generated.

LARGE_OMAP_OBJECTS
__________________

One or more pools contain large omap objects as determined by
``osd_deep_scrub_large_omap_object_key_threshold`` (threshold for number of keys
to determine a large omap object) or
``osd_deep_scrub_large_omap_object_value_sum_threshold`` (the threshold for
summed size (bytes) of all key values to determine a large omap object) or both.
More information on the object name, key count, and size in bytes can be found
by searching the cluster log for 'Large omap object found'. Large omap objects
can be caused by RGW bucket index objects that do not have automatic resharding
enabled. Please see :ref:`RGW Dynamic Bucket Index Resharding
<rgw_dynamic_bucket_index_resharding>` for more information on resharding.

The thresholds can be adjusted with::

  ceph config set osd osd_deep_scrub_large_omap_object_key_threshold <keys>
  ceph config set osd osd_deep_scrub_large_omap_object_value_sum_threshold <bytes>

CACHE_POOL_NEAR_FULL
____________________

A cache tier pool is nearly full.  Full in this context is determined
by the ``target_max_bytes`` and ``target_max_objects`` properties on
the cache pool.  Once the pool reaches the target threshold, write
requests to the pool may block while data is flushed and evicted
from the cache, a state that normally leads to very high latencies and
poor performance.

The cache pool target size can be adjusted with::

  ceph osd pool set <cache-pool-name> target_max_bytes <bytes>
  ceph osd pool set <cache-pool-name> target_max_objects <objects>

Normal cache flush and evict activity may also be throttled due to reduced
availability or performance of the base tier, or overall cluster load.

TOO_FEW_PGS
___________

The number of PGs in use in the cluster is below the configurable
threshold of ``mon_pg_warn_min_per_osd`` PGs per OSD.  This can lead
to suboptimal distribution and balance of data across the OSDs in
the cluster, and similarly reduce overall performance.

This may be an expected condition if data pools have not yet been
created.

The PG count for existing pools can be increased or new pools can be created.
Please refer to :ref:`choosing-number-of-placement-groups` for more
information.

POOL_PG_NUM_NOT_POWER_OF_TWO
____________________________

One or more pools has a ``pg_num`` value that is not a power of two.
Although this is not strictly incorrect, it does lead to a less
balanced distribution of data because some PGs have roughly twice as
much data as others.

This is easily corrected by setting the ``pg_num`` value for the
affected pool(s) to a nearby power of two::

  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> pg_num <value>

This health warning can be disabled with::

  ceph config set global mon_warn_on_pool_pg_num_not_power_of_two false

POOL_TOO_FEW_PGS
________________

One or more pools should probably have more PGs, based on the amount
of data that is currently stored in the pool.  This can lead to
suboptimal distribution and balance of data across the OSDs in the
cluster, and similarly reduce overall performance.  This warning is
generated if the ``pg_autoscale_mode`` property on the pool is set to
``warn``.

To disable the warning, you can disable auto-scaling of PGs for the
pool entirely with::

  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> pg_autoscale_mode off

To allow the cluster to automatically adjust the number of PGs,::

  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> pg_autoscale_mode on

You can also manually set the number of PGs for the pool to the
recommended amount with::

  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> pg_num <new-pg-num>

Please refer to :ref:`choosing-number-of-placement-groups` and
:ref:`pg-autoscaler` for more information.

TOO_MANY_PGS
____________

The number of PGs in use in the cluster is above the configurable
threshold of ``mon_max_pg_per_osd`` PGs per OSD.  If this threshold is
exceed the cluster will not allow new pools to be created, pool `pg_num` to
be increased, or pool replication to be increased (any of which would lead to
more PGs in the cluster).  A large number of PGs can lead
to higher memory utilization for OSD daemons, slower peering after
cluster state changes (like OSD restarts, additions, or removals), and
higher load on the Manager and Monitor daemons.

The simplest way to mitigate the problem is to increase the number of
OSDs in the cluster by adding more hardware.  Note that the OSD count
used for the purposes of this health check is the number of "in" OSDs,
so marking "out" OSDs "in" (if there are any) can also help::

  ceph osd in <osd id(s)>

Please refer to :ref:`choosing-number-of-placement-groups` for more
information.

POOL_TOO_MANY_PGS
_________________

One or more pools should probably have more PGs, based on the amount
of data that is currently stored in the pool.  This can lead to higher
memory utilization for OSD daemons, slower peering after cluster state
changes (like OSD restarts, additions, or removals), and higher load
on the Manager and Monitor daemons.  This warning is generated if the
``pg_autoscale_mode`` property on the pool is set to ``warn``.

To disable the warning, you can disable auto-scaling of PGs for the
pool entirely with::

  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> pg_autoscale_mode off

To allow the cluster to automatically adjust the number of PGs,::

  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> pg_autoscale_mode on

You can also manually set the number of PGs for the pool to the
recommended amount with::

  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> pg_num <new-pg-num>

Please refer to :ref:`choosing-number-of-placement-groups` and
:ref:`pg-autoscaler` for more information.

POOL_TARGET_SIZE_BYTES_OVERCOMMITTED
____________________________________

One or more pools have a ``target_size_bytes`` property set to
estimate the expected size of the pool,
but the value(s) exceed the total available storage (either by
themselves or in combination with other pools' actual usage).

This is usually an indication that the ``target_size_bytes`` value for
the pool is too large and should be reduced or set to zero with::

  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> target_size_bytes 0

更详细的内容见  :ref:`specifying_pool_target_size`.

POOL_HAS_TARGET_SIZE_BYTES_AND_RATIO
____________________________________

One or more pools have both ``target_size_bytes`` and
``target_size_ratio`` set to estimate the expected size of the pool.
Only one of these properties should be non-zero. If both are set,
``target_size_ratio`` takes precedence and ``target_size_bytes`` is
ignored.

To reset ``target_size_bytes`` to zero::

  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> target_size_bytes 0

更详细的内容见  :ref:`specifying_pool_target_size`.

TOO_FEW_OSDS
____________

The number of OSDs in the cluster is below the configurable
threshold of ``osd_pool_default_size``.

SMALLER_PGP_NUM
_______________

One or more pools has a ``pgp_num`` value less than ``pg_num``.  This
is normally an indication that the PG count was increased without
also increasing the placement behavior.

This is sometimes done deliberately to separate out the `split` step
when the PG count is adjusted from the data migration that is needed
when ``pgp_num`` is changed.

This is normally resolved by setting ``pgp_num`` to match ``pg_num``,
triggering the data migration, with::

  ceph osd pool set <pool> pgp_num <pg-num-value>

MANY_OBJECTS_PER_PG
___________________

One or more pools has an average number of objects per PG that is
significantly higher than the overall cluster average.  The specific
threshold is controlled by the ``mon_pg_warn_max_object_skew``
configuration value.

This is usually an indication that the pool(s) containing most of the
data in the cluster have too few PGs, and/or that other pools that do
not contain as much data have too many PGs.  See the discussion of
*TOO_MANY_PGS* above.

在管理器上调高 ``mon_pg_warn_max_object_skew`` 配置选项的阈值\
可以消除此健康告警。

如果把 ``pg_autoscale_mode`` 设置为 ``on`` ，某个特定存储池的健康告警就能消除。

POOL_APP_NOT_ENABLED
____________________

A pool exists that contains one or more objects but has not been
tagged for use by a particular application.

Resolve this warning by labeling the pool for use by an application.  For
example, if the pool is used by RBD,::

  rbd pool init <poolname>

If the pool is being used by a custom application 'foo', you can also label
via the low-level command::

  ceph osd pool application enable foo

更详细的内容见  :ref:`associate-pool-to-application`.

POOL_FULL
_________

One or more pools has reached (or is very close to reaching) its
quota.  The threshold to trigger this error condition is controlled by
the ``mon_pool_quota_crit_threshold`` configuration option.

Pool quotas can be adjusted up or down (or removed) with::

  ceph osd pool set-quota <pool> max_bytes <bytes>
  ceph osd pool set-quota <pool> max_objects <objects>

Setting the quota value to 0 will disable the quota.

POOL_NEAR_FULL
______________

One or more pools is approaching a configured fullness threshold.

One threshold that can trigger this warning condition is the
``mon_pool_quota_warn_threshold`` configuration option.

Pool quotas can be adjusted up or down (or removed) with::

  ceph osd pool set-quota <pool> max_bytes <bytes>
  ceph osd pool set-quota <pool> max_objects <objects>

Setting the quota value to 0 will disable the quota.

Other thresholds that can trigger the above two warning conditions are
``mon_osd_nearfull_ratio`` and ``mon_osd_full_ratio``.  Visit the
:ref:`storage-capacity` and :ref:`no-free-drive-space` documents for details
and resolution.

OBJECT_MISPLACED
________________

One or more objects in the cluster is not stored on the node the
cluster would like it to be stored on.  This is an indication that
data migration due to some recent cluster change has not yet completed.

Misplaced data is not a dangerous condition in and of itself; data
consistency is never at risk, and old copies of objects are never
removed until the desired number of new copies (in the desired
locations) are present.

OBJECT_UNFOUND
______________

One or more objects in the cluster cannot be found.  Specifically, the
OSDs know that a new or updated copy of an object should exist, but a
copy of that version of the object has not been found on OSDs that are
currently online.

Read or write requests to unfound objects will block.

Ideally, a down OSD can be brought back online that has the more
recent copy of the unfound object.  Candidate OSDs can be identified from the
peering state for the PG(s) responsible for the unfound object::

  ceph tell <pgid> query

If the latest copy of the object is not available, the cluster can be
told to roll back to a previous version of the object. See
:ref:`failures-osd-unfound` for more information.

SLOW_OPS
________

One or more OSD or monitor requests is taking a long time to process.  This can
be an indication of extreme load, a slow storage device, or a software
bug.

The request queue for the daemon in question can be queried with the
following command, executed from the daemon's host::

  ceph daemon osd.<id> ops

A summary of the slowest recent requests can be seen with::

  ceph daemon osd.<id> dump_historic_ops

OSD 的位置可用此命令找到： ::

  ceph osd find osd.<id>

PG_NOT_SCRUBBED
_______________

One or more PGs has not been scrubbed recently.  PGs are normally scrubbed
within every configured interval specified by
:confval:`osd_scrub_max_interval` globally. This
interval can be overriden on per-pool basis with
:confval:`scrub_max_interval`. The warning triggers when
``mon_warn_pg_not_scrubbed_ratio`` percentage of interval has elapsed without a
scrub since it was due.

PGs will not scrub if they are not flagged as *clean*, which may
happen if they are misplaced or degraded (see *PG_AVAILABILITY* and
*PG_DEGRADED* above).

You can manually initiate a scrub of a clean PG with::

  ceph pg scrub <pgid>

PG_NOT_DEEP_SCRUBBED
____________________

One or more PGs has not been deep scrubbed recently.  PGs are normally
scrubbed every :confval:`osd_deep_scrub_interval` seconds, and this warning
triggers when ``mon_warn_pg_not_deep_scrubbed_ratio`` percentage of interval has elapsed
without a scrub since it was due.

PGs will not (deep) scrub if they are not flagged as *clean*, which may
happen if they are misplaced or degraded (see *PG_AVAILABILITY* and
*PG_DEGRADED* above).

You can manually initiate a scrub of a clean PG with::

  ceph pg deep-scrub <pgid>


PG_SLOW_SNAP_TRIMMING
_____________________

The snapshot trim queue for one or more PGs has exceeded the
configured warning threshold.  This indicates that either an extremely
large number of snapshots were recently deleted, or that the OSDs are
unable to trim snapshots quickly enough to keep up with the rate of
new snapshot deletions.

The warning threshold is controlled by the
``mon_osd_snap_trim_queue_warn_on`` option (default: 32768).

This warning may trigger if OSDs are under excessive load and unable
to keep up with their background work, or if the OSDs' internal
metadata database is heavily fragmented and unable to perform.  It may
also indicate some other performance issue with the OSDs.

The exact size of the snapshot trim queue is reported by the
``snaptrimq_len`` field of ``ceph pg ls -f json-detail``.


杂项
----
.. Miscellaneous

RECENT_CRASH
____________

One or more Ceph daemons has crashed recently, and the crash has not
yet been archived (acknowledged) by the administrator.  This may
indicate a software bug, a hardware problem (e.g., a failing disk), or
some other problem.

New crashes can be listed with::

  ceph crash ls-new

Information about a specific crash can be examined with::

  ceph crash info <crash-id>

This warning can be silenced by "archiving" the crash (perhaps after
being examined by an administrator) so that it does not generate this
warning::

  ceph crash archive <crash-id>

Similarly, all new crashes can be archived with::

  ceph crash archive-all

Archived crashes will still be visible via ``ceph crash ls`` but not
``ceph crash ls-new``.

The time period for what "recent" means is controlled by the option
``mgr/crash/warn_recent_interval`` (default: two weeks).

These warnings can be disabled entirely with::

  ceph config set mgr/crash/warn_recent_interval 0

RECENT_MGR_MODULE_CRASH
_______________________

One or more ceph-mgr modules has crashed recently, and the crash as
not yet been archived (acknowledged) by the administrator.  This
generally indicates a software bug in one of the software modules run
inside the ceph-mgr daemon.  Although the module that experienced the
problem maybe be disabled as a result, the function of other modules
is normally unaffected.

As with the *RECENT_CRASH* health alert, the crash can be inspected with::

    ceph crash info <crash-id>

This warning can be silenced by "archiving" the crash (perhaps after
being examined by an administrator) so that it does not generate this
warning::

  ceph crash archive <crash-id>

Similarly, all new crashes can be archived with::

  ceph crash archive-all

Archived crashes will still be visible via ``ceph crash ls`` but not
``ceph crash ls-new``.

The time period for what "recent" means is controlled by the option
``mgr/crash/warn_recent_interval`` (default: two weeks).

These warnings can be disabled entirely with::

  ceph config set mgr/crash/warn_recent_interval 0

TELEMETRY_CHANGED
_________________

Telemetry has been enabled, but the contents of the telemetry report
have changed since that time, so telemetry reports will not be sent.

The Ceph developers periodically revise the telemetry feature to
include new and useful information, or to remove information found to
be useless or sensitive.  If any new information is included in the
report, Ceph will require the administrator to re-enable telemetry to
ensure they have an opportunity to (re)review what information will be
shared.

To review the contents of the telemetry report,::

  ceph telemetry show

Note that the telemetry report consists of several optional channels
that may be independently enabled or disabled.  更详细的内容见 
:ref:`telemetry`.

要重新启用 telemetry （并消除这条警报）::

  ceph telemetry on

要禁用 telemetry （并消除这条警报）::

  ceph telemetry off

AUTH_BAD_CAPS
_____________

One or more auth users has capabilities that cannot be parsed by the
monitor.  This generally indicates that the user will not be
authorized to perform any action with one or more daemon types.

This error is mostly likely to occur after an upgrade if the
capabilities were set with an older version of Ceph that did not
properly validate their syntax, or if the syntax of the capabilities
has changed.

The user in question can be removed with::

  ceph auth rm <entity-name>

(This will resolve the health alert, but obviously clients will not be
able to authenticate as that user.)

Alternatively, the capabilities for the user can be updated with::

  ceph auth <entity-name> <daemon-type> <caps> [<daemon-type> <caps> ...]

For more information about auth capabilities, see :ref:`user-management`.

OSD_NO_DOWN_OUT_INTERVAL
________________________

The ``mon_osd_down_out_interval`` option is set to zero, which means
that the system will not automatically perform any repair or healing
operations after an OSD fails.  Instead, an administrator (or some
other external entity) will need to manually mark down OSDs as 'out'
(i.e., via ``ceph osd out <osd-id>``) in order to trigger recovery.

这个选项通常设置成 5 或 10 分钟 - 足够一台主机更换电源或重启。

把 ``mon_warn_on_osd_down_out_interval_zero`` 设置成 false 可以消除这个警报::

  ceph config global mon mon_warn_on_osd_down_out_interval_zero false

DASHBOARD_DEBUG
_______________

打开了 Dashboard 调试模式。这意味着，如果在处理一个 REST API 请求时出错了，
HTTP 错误响应会包含 Python 的追溯信息（ traceback ）。
这个行为在生产环境下应该禁用，因为\
这样的回溯信息可能包含并暴露敏感信息。

调试模式可以这样关闭::

  ceph dashboard debug disable
