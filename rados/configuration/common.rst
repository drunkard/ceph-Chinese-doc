通用选项
========

The `Hardware Recommendations`_ section provides some hardware guidelines for
configuring a Ceph Storage Cluster. It is possible for a single :term:`Ceph
Node` to run multiple daemons. For example, a single node with multiple drives
may run one ``ceph-osd`` for each drive. Ideally, you will  have a node for a
particular type of process. For example, some nodes may run ``ceph-osd``
daemons, other nodes may run ``ceph-mds`` daemons, and still  other nodes may
run ``ceph-mon`` daemons.

Each node has a name identified by the ``host`` setting. Monitors also specify
a network address and port (i.e., domain name or IP address) identified by the
``addr`` setting.  A basic configuration file will typically specify only
minimal settings for each instance of monitor daemons. For example:

.. code-block:: ini

	[global]
	mon_initial_members = ceph1
	mon_host = 10.0.0.1


.. important:: The ``host`` setting is the short name of the node (i.e., not
   an fqdn). It is **NOT** an IP address either.  Enter ``hostname -s`` on
   the command line to retrieve the name of the node. Do not use ``host``
   settings for anything other than initial monitors unless you are deploying
   Ceph manually. You **MUST NOT** specify ``host`` under individual daemons
   when using deployment tools like ``chef`` or ``cephadm``, as those tools
   will enter the appropriate values for you in the cluster map.

监视器
======
.. Monitors

Ceph production clusters typically deploy with a minimum 3 :term:`Ceph Monitor`
daemons to ensure high availability should a monitor instance crash. At least
three (3) monitors ensures that the Paxos algorithm can determine which version
of the :term:`Ceph Cluster Map` is the most recent from a majority of Ceph
Monitors in the quorum.

.. note:: You may deploy Ceph with a single monitor, but if the instance fails,
	       the lack of other monitors may interrupt data service availability.

Ceph Monitors normally listen on port ``3300`` for the new v2 protocol, and ``6789`` for the old v1 protocol.

By default, Ceph expects that you will store a monitor's data under the
following path::

	/var/lib/ceph/mon/$cluster-$id

You or a deployment tool (e.g., ``cephadm``) must create the corresponding
directory. With metavariables fully  expressed and a cluster named "ceph", the
foregoing directory would evaluate to::

	/var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-a

For additional details, see the `Monitor Config Reference`_.

.. Authentication

.. versionadded:: Bobtail 0.56

For Bobtail (v 0.56) and beyond, you should expressly enable or disable
authentication in the ``[global]`` section of your Ceph configuration file.

.. code-block:: ini

	auth_cluster_required = cephx
	auth_service_required = cephx
	auth_client_required = cephx

Additionally, you should enable message signing. See `Cephx Config Reference`_ for details.

.. _ceph-monitor-config:


OSDs
====

Ceph production clusters typically deploy :term:`Ceph OSD Daemons` where one node
has one OSD daemon running a filestore on one storage drive. A typical
deployment specifies a journal size. For example:

.. code-block:: ini

	[osd]
	osd journal size = 10000

	[osd.0]
	host = {hostname} #manual deployments only.


By default, Ceph expects to store a Ceph OSD Daemon's data at the
following path::

	/var/lib/ceph/osd/$cluster-$id

You or a deployment tool (e.g., ``cephadm``) must create the corresponding
directory. With metavariables fully expressed and a cluster named "ceph", this
example would evaluate to::

	/var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-0

You may override this path using the ``osd data`` setting. We don't recommend
changing the default location. Create the default directory on your OSD host.

.. prompt:: bash $

	ssh {osd-host}
	sudo mkdir /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-{osd-number}

The ``osd data`` path ideally leads to a mount point with a hard disk that is
separate from the hard disk storing and running the operating system and
daemons. If the OSD is for a disk other than the OS disk, prepare it for
use with Ceph, and mount it to the directory you just created

.. prompt:: bash $

	ssh {new-osd-host}
	sudo mkfs -t {fstype} /dev/{disk}
	sudo mount -o user_xattr /dev/{hdd} /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-{osd-number}

We recommend using the ``xfs`` file system when running
:command:`mkfs`.  (``btrfs`` and ``ext4`` are not recommended and no
longer tested.)

See the `OSD Config Reference`_ for additional configuration details.


心跳
====
.. Heartbeats

During runtime operations, Ceph OSD Daemons check up on other Ceph OSD Daemons
and report their  findings to the Ceph Monitor. You do not have to provide any
settings. However, if you have network latency issues, you may wish to modify
the settings.

See `Configuring Monitor/OSD Interaction`_ for additional details.

====================
.. Naming Clusters (deprecated)

Each Ceph cluster has an internal name that is used as part of configuration
and log file names as well as directory and mountpoint names.  This name
defaults to "ceph".  Previous releases of Ceph allowed one to specify a custom
name instead, for example "ceph2".  This was intended to faciliate running
multiple logical clusters on the same physical hardware, but in practice this
was rarely exploited and should no longer be attempted.  Prior documentation
could also be misinterpreted as requiring unique cluster names in order to
use ``rbd-mirror``.

Custom cluster names are now considered deprecated and the ability to deploy
them has already been removed from some tools, though existing custom name
deployments continue to operate.  The ability to run and manage clusters with
custom names may be progressively removed by future Ceph releases, so it is
strongly recommended to deploy all new clusters with the default name "ceph".

Some Ceph CLI commands accept an optional ``--cluster`` (cluster name) option. This
option is present purely for backward compatibility and need not be accomodated
by new tools and deployments.

If you do need to allow multiple clusters to exist on the same host, please use
:ref:`cephadm`, which uses containers to fully isolate each cluster.
