.. Shared, Read-only Parent Image Cache

`Cloned RBD images`_ from a parent usually only modify a small portion of
the image. For example, in a VDI workload, the VMs are cloned from the same
base image and initially only differ by hostname and IP address. During the
booting stage, all of these VMs would re-read portions of duplicate parent
image data from the RADOS cluster. If we have a local cache of the parent
image, this will help to speed up the read process on one host, as well as
to save the client to cluster network traffic.
RBD shared read-only parent image cache requires explicitly enabling in
``ceph.conf``. The ``ceph-immutable-object-cache`` daemon is responsible for
caching the parent content on the local disk, and future reads on that data
will be serviced from the local cache.

.. note:: RBD shared read-only parent image cache requires the Ceph Nautilus release or later.

启用 RBD 的共享只读父映像缓存功能
---------------------------------
.. Enable RBD Shared Read-only Parent Image Cache

To enable RBD shared read-only parent image cache, the following Ceph settings
need to added in the ``[client]`` `section`_ of your ``ceph.conf`` file::

        rbd parent cache enabled = true
        rbd plugins = parent_cache


不可变对象缓存守护进程

.. Immutable Object Cache Daemon

Introduction and Generic Settings
---------------------------------

The ``ceph-immutable-object-cache`` daemon is responsible for caching parent
image content within its local caching directory. For better performance it's
recommended to use SSDs as the underlying storage.

The key components of the daemon are:

#. **Domain socket based IPC:** The daemon will listen on a local domain
   socket on start up and wait for connections from librbd clients.

#. **LRU based promotion/demotion policy:** The daemon will maintain
   in-memory statistics of cache-hits on each cache file. It will demote the
   cold cache if capacity reaches to the configured threshold.

#. **File-based caching store:** The daemon will maintain a simple file
   based cache store. On promotion the RADOS objects will be fetched from
   RADOS cluster and stored in the local caching directory.

On opening each cloned rbd image, ``librbd`` will try to connect to the
cache daemon through its Unix domain socket. Once successfully connected,
``librbd`` will coordinate with the daemon on the subsequent reads.
If there's a read that's not cached, the daemon will promote the RADOS object
to local caching directory, so the next read on that object will be serviced
from cache. The daemon also maintains simple LRU statistics so that under
capacity pressure it will evict cold cache files as needed.

Here are some important cache configuration settings:

``immutable_object_cache_sock``

:Description: The path to the domain socket used for communication between
              librbd clients and the ceph-immutable-object-cache daemon.
:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: ``/var/run/ceph/immutable_object_cache_sock``


``immutable_object_cache_path``

:Description: The immutable object cache data directory.
:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: ``/tmp/ceph_immutable_object_cache``


``immutable_object_cache_max_size``

:Description: The max size for immutable cache.
:Type: Size
:Required: No
:Default: ``1G``


``immutable_object_cache_watermark``

:Description: The high-water mark for the cache. The value is between (0, 1).
              If the cache size reaches this threshold the daemon will start
              to delete cold cache based on LRU statistics.
:Type: Float
:Required: No
:Default: ``0.9``

The ``ceph-immutable-object-cache`` daemon is available within the optional
``ceph-immutable-object-cache`` distribution package.

.. important:: ``ceph-immutable-object-cache`` daemon requires the ability to
   connect RADOS clusters.

Running the Immutable Object Cache Daemon
-----------------------------------------

``ceph-immutable-object-cache`` daemon should use a unique Ceph user ID.
To `create a Ceph user`_, with ``ceph`` specify the ``auth get-or-create``
command, user name, monitor caps, and OSD caps::

  ceph auth get-or-create client.ceph-immutable-object-cache.{unique id} mon 'allow r' osd 'profile rbd-read-only'

The ``ceph-immutable-object-cache`` daemon can be managed by ``systemd`` by specifying the user
ID as the daemon instance::

  systemctl enable ceph-immutable-object-cache@ceph-immutable-object-cache.{unique id}

The ``ceph-immutable-object-cache`` can also be run in foreground by ``ceph-immutable-object-cache`` command::

  ceph-immutable-object-cache -f --log-file={log_path}

QOS Settings
------------

The immutable object cache supports throttling, controlled by the following settings:

``immutable_object_cache_qos_schedule_tick_min``

:Description: Minimum schedule tick for immutable object cache.
:Type: Milliseconds
:Required: No
:Default: ``50``


``immutable_object_cache_qos_iops_limit``

:Description: The desired immutable object cache IO operations limit per second.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: No
:Default: ``0``


``immutable_object_cache_qos_iops_burst``

:Description: The desired burst limit of immutable object cache IO operations.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: No
:Default: ``0``


``immutable_object_cache_qos_iops_burst_seconds``

:Description: The desired burst duration in seconds of immutable object cache IO operations.
:Type: Seconds
:Required: No
:Default: ``1``


``immutable_object_cache_qos_bps_limit``

:Description: The desired immutable object cache IO bytes limit per second.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: No
:Default: ``0``


``immutable_object_cache_qos_bps_burst``

:Description: The desired burst limit of immutable object cache IO bytes.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: No
:Default: ``0``


``immutable_object_cache_qos_bps_burst_seconds``

:Description: The desired burst duration in seconds of immutable object cache IO bytes.
:Type: Seconds
:Required: No
:Default: ``1``
