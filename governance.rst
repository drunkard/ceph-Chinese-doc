Ceph 开源社区由几个不同的团体引导着。

项目负责人
----------
.. Project Leader

The Ceph project is currently led by Sage Weil <sage@redhat.com>.  The
project leader is responsible for guiding the overall direction of the
project and ensuring that the developer and user communities are
healthy.


提交者
------
.. Committers

Committers are project contributors who have write access to the central
Ceph code repositories, currently hosted on GitHub.  This group of developers
is collectively empowered to make changes to the Ceph source code.

Generally speaking, no individual should make a change in isolation:
all code contributions go through a collaborative review process (and
undergo testing) before being merged.  The specifics of this process
are dynamic and evolving over time.

New committers are added to the project (or committers removed from
the project) at the discretion of the Ceph Leadership Team (below).
The criteria for becoming a contributor include a consistent level of
quality and engagement in the project over time.

Ceph 领导团队
-------------
.. Ceph Leadership Team

The Ceph Leadership Team (CLT) is a collection of component leads and
other core developers who collectively make technical decisions for
the project.  These decisions are generally made by consensus,
although voting may be used if necessary.

The CLT meets weekly via video chat to discuss any pending issues or
decisions.  Minutes for the CLT meetings are published at
`https://pad.ceph.com/p/clt-weekly-minutes <https://pad.ceph.com/p/clt-weekly-minutes>`_.

Committers are added to or removed from the CLT at the discretion of
the CLT itself.

Current CLT members are:

 * Casey Bodley <cbodley@redhat.com>
 * Dan van der Ster <daniel.vanderster@cern.ch>
 * David Galloway <dgallowa@redhat.com>
 * David Orman <ormandj@iland.com>

组件负责人
----------
.. Component Leads

Each major subcomponent of the Ceph project has a lead engineer who is
responsible for guiding and coordinating development.  The leads are
nominated or appointed at the discretion of the project leader or the
CLT.  Leads responsibilities include:

 * guiding the (usually) daily "stand-up" coordination calls over video chat
 * building the development roadmap for each release cycle
 * coordinating development activity between contributors
 * ensuring that contributions are reviewed
 * ensuring that different proposed changes do not conflict
 * ensuring that testing remains robust (new features include tests, changes do not break tests, etc.)

All component leads are included on the CLT.  They are expected to
report progress and status updates to the rest of the leadership team
and to help facilitate any cross-component coordination of
development.


Ceph 基金会
-----------
.. The Ceph Foundation

The Ceph Foundation is organized as a directed fund under the Linux
Foundation and is tasked with supporting the Ceph project community
and ecosystem.  It has no direct control over the technical direction
of the Ceph open source project beyond offering feedback and input
into the collaborative development process.
