 Ceph 基金会
=============

The Ceph Foundation exists to enable industry members to collaborate
and pool resources to support the Ceph project community. The
Foundation provides an open, collaborative, and neutral home for
project stakeholders to coordinate their development and community
investments in the Ceph ecosystem.

The Ceph Foundation is organized as a directed fund under the Linux
Foundation. Premier and General Member organizations contribute a
yearly fee to become members. Associate members are educational
institutions or government organizations and are invited to join at no
cost.
